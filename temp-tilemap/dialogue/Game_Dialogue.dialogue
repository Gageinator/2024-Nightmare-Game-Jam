~ traveler
: You find a note by the sink.
James: A Traveler of a Thousand Faces. I've never heard of it.
: The letter reads as follows: A traveler of no renown. A wretched man plagued by thoughts vile. Set out to find an undeserved fortune. To the kingdom he went, wearing the face of a general of the northern kingdom. 
: By night he arrived at lone castle, stretching far up into the sky. The guards, not aware of the wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing allowed him through the gates. Through the West wing he slithered, donning the face of a maiden fair. Claiming to be the princess, guards allowed the traveler within the chamber where the king lie in slumber. 
: And once the doors shut and the traveler knew no prying eyes were watching, from below, he grasped a knife and raised it above the unsuspecting man.
: Down the blade flew, piercing the flesh. Again and again, it went. Rending, tearing, seething unyielding pain. 
: Until all that remains was a husk of what once was.
